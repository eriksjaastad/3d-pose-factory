# Mission Control Dashboard

**Beautiful web UI for managing RunPod jobs - because terminals are sad.** 🎨

---

## What This Is

A local web dashboard that runs on your Mac and gives you a visual interface for:
- 📊 Viewing job status in real-time
- ➕ Submitting new jobs (no terminal!)
- 📥 Downloading results with one click
- 🖼️ Previewing rendered images
- 🤖 Monitoring pod agent health
- 📋 Viewing live logs

**No more staring at terminal output!**

## Quick Start

```bash
# First time setup
cd dashboard
doppler run -- python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the dashboard (subsequent runs)
cd dashboard
source venv/bin/activate
doppler run -- python3 app.py

# Browser auto-opens to: http://localhost:5001
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cd dashboard
source venv/bin/activate
./run_tests.sh

# Or run specific test file
doppler run -- python -m pytest tests/test_cost_calculator.py -v
```
